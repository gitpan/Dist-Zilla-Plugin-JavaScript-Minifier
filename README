NAME

    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::JavaScript::Minifier - Minify JavaScript in your
    dist.

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     [JavaScript::Minifier]

DESCRIPTION

    Compress JavaScript files in your distribution using
    JavaScript::Minifier::XS. By default for each foo.js file in your
    distribution this plugin will create a foo.min.js which has been
    compressed.

ATTRIBUTES

 finder

    Specifies a FileFinder for the JavaScript files that you want
    compressed. If this is not specified, it will compress all the
    JavaScript files that do not have a .min. in their filenames. Roughly
    equivalent to this:

     [FileFinder::ByName / JavaScriptFiles]
     file = *.js
     skip = .min.
     [JavaScript::Minifier]
     finder = JavaScriptFiles

 output_regex

    Regular expression substitution used to generate the output filenames.
    By default this is

     [JavaScript::Minifier]
     output_regex = /\.js$/.min.js/

    which generates a foo.min.js for each foo.js.

 output

    Output filename. Not used by default, but if specified, all JavaScript
    files are merged and compressed into a single file using this as the
    output filename.

METHODS

 $plugin->gather_files( $arg )

    This method adds the compressed JavaScript files to your distribution.
